# Home assistant add-on: MedAssist

MedAssist is a simple Node.js application made with love to help my partner manage their daily medications. It makes it easy to keep track of medication inventory and reorder on time by sending reminders. If you're unsure whether a dose was taken, just check the dashboard, and comparing the expected stock with the actual quantity can help confirm. For travel, MedAssist takes away the stress by generating a quick list of all necessary medications for the time youâ€™ll be away.

## Features
If you take at least one medication on a regular schedule, this app might be useful. But if you manage multiple medications with complex schedules, you might enjoy it even more.

- Track medication inventory and know exactly when to reorder
- Receive email reminders when supplies are low
- Generate a custom medication list for travel, including quantities needed for your chosen timeframe (optionally send by e-mail)
- Simple dashboard showing medication status and upcoming schedules
- User friendly web interface for easy medication management and configuration
