# Home assistant add-on: TypeDrawType

Type Draw Type is a simple and fun game for you and your friends. It is like the telephone game (Chinese whispers), only with pictures. Every player starts by typing a sentence. Then the texts are passed on and you have to draw the sentence you received. In the next round you get one of the drawings and have to describe it with another sentence (without knowing the initial sentence!). This goes on, by alternately typing and drawing, until all players have participated in every chain (story). In the end everybody sees all the stories and can wonder about how the initial sentences have transformed in unexpected ways!
