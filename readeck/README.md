## About

This addon is based on the [docker image](https://codeberg.org/readeck/readeck).

## Features

### üîñ Bookmarks

Like a page you're reading? Paste the link in Readeck and you're done!

### üì∏ Articles, pictures and videos

Readeck saves the readable content of web pages for you to read later. It also detects when a page is an image or a video and adapts its process accordingly.

### ‚≠ê Labels, favorites, archives

Move bookmarks to archives or favorites and add as many labels as you want.

### üñçÔ∏è Highlights

Highlight the important content of your bookmarks to easily find it later.

### üóÉÔ∏è Collections

If you need a dedicated section with all your bookmarks from the past 2 weeks labeled with "cat", Readeck lets you save this search query into a collection so you can access it later.

### üß© Browser Extension

Want to keep something for later while browsing? No need to copy and paste a link. Install the browser extension and save bookmarks in one click!

### üìñ E-Book export

What's best than reading your collected articles on your e-reader? You can export any article to an e-book file (EPUB). You can even export a collection to a single book!

On top of that, you can directly access Readeck's catalog and collections from your e-reader if it supports OPDS.

### üîé Full text search

Whether you need to find a vague piece of text from an article, or all the articles with a specific label or from a specific website, we've got you covered!

### üöÄ Fast!

Readeck is a modern take on so called boring, but proven, technology pieces. It guaranties very quick response times and a smooth user experience.

### üîí Built for your privacy and long term archival

Will this article you like be online next year? In 10 year? Maybe not; maybe it's all gone, text and images. For this reason, and for your privacy, text and images are all stored in your Readeck instance the moment you save a link.

With the exception of videos, not a single request is made from your browser to an external website.
